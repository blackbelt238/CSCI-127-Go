# CSCI-127-Go
My solutions for assignments from John Paxton's spring 2018 offering of the Joy and Beauty of Data, done in Go. This is meant to mirror my [CSCI-127](https://github.com/blackbelt238/CSCI-127/) repository, which holds the contains the more faithful Python solutions.

Since the In-Labs are meant to help students gain experience with concepts they recently learn, I will likely only complete the Programs in Go.
