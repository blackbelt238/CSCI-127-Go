# Program 4: Pokédex

For [program 4](https://github.com/blackbelt238/CSCI-127/tree/master/Programs/4), Paxton provides code for adding Pokémon to a Pokédex. From that code, students are expected to create the necessary Pokémon class and add functions to support the Pokédex's functionality.

I expand the scope of the assignment a little and create an additional class, representing a Pokédex.
